# Conclusions
•	Amazon heavily relies on discount-led selling.
•	Despite high discount rating remains strong which indicate customers values perceived deals.
•	Large reviews volume indicates high customer engagement and trust.
•	Low rated products are rare but risky.
•	Majority of product lie between 4.0 to 4.5 very few products below 3.5 indicates strong quality control or review moderation.
•	Low rated product should be monitor or delisted.
•	Most of the product fall between 30% to 70% discount and extreme discount 80% to 90% exist but are fewer.
•	Very Low discount less than 10% are uncommon.
•	No strong correlation between higher discount equal to higher rating.
•	 Product with 0% to 20% discount still achieve 4 + rating.
•	Over discounting does not improve customer satisfaction.
•	Sellers are losing margin over unnecessarily discount. 
•	Product with high reviews 100k+ mostly stay around 4.0 and 4.3
•	Rating stabilizes as reviews increase.
•	Hight ticket items more than 50k still receive heavy discount.
•	Early reviews are critical for the product success.

•	Electronic dominates the platform.
•	Other categories are niche and underrepresented.
•	 Non -core categories have growth opportunity but low focus.

•	Push review acquisition for new products
